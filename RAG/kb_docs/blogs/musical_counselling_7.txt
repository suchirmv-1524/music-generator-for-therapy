If you struggle with stress, anxiety or worry, lack of boundaries, and are simply feeling out of balance, I am the therapist for you. If you need someone who is going to hold you accountable, and help you identify exactly where you want to go and come up with an effective plan to get you there, I can help. While there is no “one size fits all” approach to therapy, I can support you in helping you find your authentic self and what you value most, while taking into consideration that you know what you need most. I also specialize in working with couples, helping them find solutions to even the most difficult challenges.

Imagine waking up with energy. You didn’t struggle to fall asleep. You didn’t wake up throughout the night. You didn’t have nightmares. You got through the night without flashbacks, without going over and over the past in your mind. You’d wake up and get out of bed. And because you didn’t feel like you ran a marathon overnight, you’d greet the day with peace and contentment… Even excitement for all the things you can accomplish, since you aren’t weighed down by exhaustion, anxiety, or depression. You wouldn’t be so worried about all the potential triggers… All of the things you could come across in a day that could bring you right

will begin by assessing the client’s specific needs and getting a sense of their musical ability and interests. Musical training is not required, and clients of all ages can benefit from this type of therapy. The therapist will then make a plan for how to achieve the client’s therapeutic goal(s) using a range of receptive (e.g., listening to a song) and active (e.g., drumming in a group) music therapy techniques.
What are some common music therapy techniques?
Music therapy usually involves listening to music (either live or recorded). Music therapy clients may also make music on popular instruments, such as the piano, guitar, and hand drum, or sing. Sometimes music therapy can include guided imagery. A music therapist may ask clients to improvise on the spot or even compose their own songs. Dancing or moving to music can be an effective intervention to help clients feel more fully grounded in their bodies and remain in the present moment.
How does music therapy help with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)?
Music therapy can be a valuable creative outlet for clients with
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD
) who have trouble putting their painful feelings into words. Listening to music can be relaxing while making music as part of a group provides plenty of opportunities to connect with other people. In addition to its mood-boosting effects, music therapy can help clients build resilience and overcome PTSD symptoms that may interfere with their daily lives.
How long does music therapy take?
Music therapy sessions generally last between 30 and 50 minutes. They can be scheduled in advance (for example, once a week) or can be done on an as-needed basis. Some clients will only require a handful of music therapy sessions to achieve their goals, while others may need months or longer, depending on their specific concern.
