Is your "to-do" list never-ending, and accomplishments never good enough? Are you overwhelmed by tasks and feel your worth depends on how much you get done? If anxiety is always at your heels, you may be struggling with perfectionism. Negative self-image- constantly comparing yourself to others, or feeling like a burden are some symptoms of perfectionism. These feelings often stem from deep-seated shame. Anxiety shows up in many different forms but usually feels like racing thoughts, racing heart, and restlessness making it hard to unwind. Guilt and shame, especially rooted in trauma, can distort your sense of self and reality.

will begin by assessing the client’s specific needs and getting a sense of their musical ability and interests. Musical training is not required, and clients of all ages can benefit from this type of therapy. The therapist will then make a plan for how to achieve the client’s therapeutic goal(s) using a range of receptive (e.g., listening to a song) and active (e.g., drumming in a group) music therapy techniques.
What are some common music therapy techniques?
Music therapy usually involves listening to music (either live or recorded). Music therapy clients may also make music on popular instruments, such as the piano, guitar, and hand drum, or sing. Sometimes music therapy can include guided imagery. A music therapist may ask clients to improvise on the spot or even compose their own songs. Dancing or moving to music can be an effective intervention to help clients feel more fully grounded in their bodies and remain in the present moment.
How does music therapy help with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)?
Music therapy can be a valuable creative outlet for clients with
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD
) who have trouble putting their painful feelings into words. Listening to music can be relaxing while making music as part of a group provides plenty of opportunities to connect with other people. In addition to its mood-boosting effects, music therapy can help clients build resilience and overcome PTSD symptoms that may interfere with their daily lives.
How long does music therapy take?
Music therapy sessions generally last between 30 and 50 minutes. They can be scheduled in advance (for example, once a week) or can be done on an as-needed basis. Some clients will only require a handful of music therapy sessions to achieve their goals, while others may need months or longer, depending on their specific concern.
