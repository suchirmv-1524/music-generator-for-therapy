The validity and utility of translated instruments (psychological measures) 
depend on the quality of their translation, and differences in key linguistic 
characteristics could introduce bias. Likewise, linguistic differences between 
instruments designed to measure analogous constructs might contribute to similar 
instruments possessing dissimilar psychometrics. This article introduces and 
demonstrates the use of natural language processing (NLP), a subfield of 
artificial intelligence, to linguistically analyze 13 translations of two 
psychological measures previously translated into numerous languages. NLP was 
used to generate estimates reflecting specific linguistic characteristics of 
test items (emotional tone/intensity, sentiment, valence, arousal, and 
dominance), which were then compared across translations at both the test- and 
item-level, as well as between the two instruments. Results revealed that key 
linguistic characteristics can profoundly vary both within and between tests. 
Following a discussion of results, the current limitations of this approach are 
summarized and strategies for advancing this methodology are proposed.
