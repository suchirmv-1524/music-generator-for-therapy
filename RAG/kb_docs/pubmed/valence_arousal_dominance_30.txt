OBJECTIVE: Aging produces changes in emotional reactivity and the retrieval of 
autobiographical memories. The main aim of this study was to assess age-related 
differences, comparing emotion induction and autobiographical memory recall 
using photos from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) that are 
thematically related to childhood.
METHOD: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted, with the 
participation of 327 individuals (168 young adults and 159 older adults) with no 
cognitive impairment and aged between 18 and 88 years. We showed the 
participants a set of five pictures from the IAPS, the affective content of 
which was related to childhood. Two of these were considered to be positive 
images, two negative and one neutral, according to the valence of these pictures 
in the literature. The main study variables were the reactions associated with 
emotional valence or pleasure, arousal and dominance, after viewing the photos, 
and the autobiographical memories retrieved by the participants.
RESULTS: The younger adults retrieved a larger number of memories than their 
older counterparts. As regards the responses to the five affective pictures 
(IAPS) on valence, arousal and dominance (IAPS), statistically significant 
differences were only found for pictures 2,345 (BlackEye), with a more positive 
valence in the group of older adults and higher arousal in the young ones, and 
2,312 (Mother), with a more positive valence in the group of older persons. A 
greater number of memories were retrieved for the photos that generated higher 
levels of pleasure, greater relaxation and greater emotional control.
CONCLUSION: Of the variables that may be associated with the elicitation of 
involuntary autobiographical memories, the most significant are age and a 
positive stimulus.
