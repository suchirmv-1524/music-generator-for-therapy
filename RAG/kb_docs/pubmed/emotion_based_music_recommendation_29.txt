Music is important in everyday life, and music therapy can help treat a variety 
of health issues. Music listening is a technique used by music therapists in 
various clinical treatments. As a result, music therapists must have an 
intelligent system at their disposal to assist and support them in selecting the 
most appropriate music for each patient. Previous research has not thoroughly 
addressed the relationship between music features and their effects on patients. 
The current paper focuses on identifying and predicting whether music has 
therapeutic benefits. A machine learning model is developed, using a multi-class 
neural network to classify emotions into four categories and then predict the 
output. The neural network developed has three layers: (i) an input layer with 
multiple features; (ii) a deep connected hidden layer; (iii) an output layer. 
K-Fold Cross Validation was used to assess the estimator. The experiment aims to 
create a machine-learning model that can predict whether a specific song has 
therapeutic effects on a specific person. The model considers a person's musical 
and emotional characteristics but is also trained to consider solfeggio 
frequencies. During the training phase, a subset of the Million Dataset is used. 
The user selects their favorite type of music and their current mood to allow 
the model to make a prediction. If the selected song is inappropriate, the 
application, using Machine Learning, recommends another type of music that may 
be useful for that specific user. An ongoing study is underway to validate the 
Machine Learning model. The developed system has been tested on many 
individuals. Because it achieved very good performance indicators, the proposed 
solution can be used by music therapists or even patients to select the 
appropriate song for their treatment.
