BACKGROUND: Sadness can be a harbinger of serious medical conditions and a 
primary manifestation of depressive symptoms. Music is a promising modality for 
regulating sadness, although its effect on participants, whether with or without 
long-term depressive symptoms, remains unknown. In this study, the effect of 
music on sadness regulation was investigated using psychological and 
physiological indicators between depressed and non-depressed individuals.
METHODS: Data were collected from 149 participants (18 to 29 years old). The 
participants were divided into two groups (depressed and non-depressed groups) 
based on their depressive symptoms, experienced sadness induction, and music 
intervention. Electrocardiogram signals were collected to measure heart rate 
variability (HRV).
RESULTS: (1) Music alleviated sadness (increasing positive emotions, valence and 
dominance, while decreasing arousal); (2) sadness increased the duration between 
consecutive heartbeats, and music decreased this duration; (3) participants with 
depressive symptoms showed lower HRV than those without, and music enhanced HRV 
for the depressed group; (4) no significant difference in the effects of music 
was found between the two groups; and (5) the regulatory impact of music on 
sadness was not influenced by prior music listening habits.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that listening to music can be beneficial for 
both healthy and subclinical individuals when managing sadness. The findings 
underscore the importance of recognizing the role of music in promoting 
emotional well-being.
