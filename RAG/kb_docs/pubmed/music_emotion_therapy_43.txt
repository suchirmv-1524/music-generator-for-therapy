OBJECTIVE: This study aims to improve the clinical nursing model by exploring 
the effects of child-friendly music nursing in the ward on the mental health of 
children with Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis (HSPN).
METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 105 children 
with HSPN treated at our hospital from January 2022 to December 2023. Five cases 
were excluded, resulting in the inclusion of 100 cases. Based on different 
nursing methods, the children were divided into the reference group (routine 
nursing, n = 52) and the observation group (child-friendly music nursing plus 
routine nursing, n = 48). A comparison was made between the two groups regarding 
the levels of anxiety and depression, inflammatory and immune function indexes 
[C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α 
(TNF-α), and immunoglobulin A (IgA)], and renal function indexes [serum 
creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and hemoglobin (HB)].
RESULTS: Before nursing, there were no significant differences between the two 
groups in terms of levels of anxiety and depression, inflammatory and immune 
function indexes (such as CRP, IL-6, TNF-α, and IgA), and renal function indexes 
(such as Scr, BUN, and HB, P > 0.05). After nursing, the observation group 
demonstrated significantly lower levels of anxiety, depression, CRP, IL-6, 
TNF-α, and IgA (P < 0.05) compared to the the reference group, while no 
significant differences were observed in Scr, BUN, and HB (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Child-friendly music nursing can improve the inflammatory level and 
immune function of children with HSPN to a certain extent. At the same time, it 
can also improve the anxiety and depression of children. Therefore, 
child-friendly music nursing in the ward is helpful for the recovery of the 
physical and mental health of children with HSPN, with a potential clinical 
application value.
