Entrepreneurial intention (EI) is a crucial requirement for encouraging 
significant entrepreneurial activity, which is essential for economic growth and 
social stability. Cultivating college students' EI is a critical element of 
higher education. Based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), this study 
constructs a moderated mediation model, aiming to explore the intricate 
processes and conditioning elements that influence the EI of college students 
and investigate the mediating role of future time perspective (FTP) between 
positive emotion (PE) and entrepreneurial intention (EI) among Chinese college 
students, as well as the moderating role of gender. In this study, we used a 
questionnaire survey method to collect a valid sample of 890 college students in 
China through Questionnaire Star (https://www.wix.cn; an online questionnaire 
collection platform widely used in various research fields in China) and used 
SPSS and AOMS to conduct the preliminary statistics and reliability tests. 
PROCESS version 3.5 by Hayes (a plug-in for SPSS) was used for hypothesis 
testing. The findings revealed that PE significantly positively influenced EI, 
and FTP completely mediated the relationship between PE and EI. However, it was 
discovered that gender did not exhibit any significant moderating effect on the 
influence of PE on EI through FTP. The findings of this study enhance our 
comprehension of the significance of PE among college students and expand our 
awareness of the mechanisms and circumstances in which PE impacts EI. This study 
serves as a reminder to educators to prioritize the role of FTP and gender 
intervention in the development of EI among college students but also offers 
empirical evidence and practical recommendations for effectively fostering EI 
among college students. Furthermore, the results of this study establish a 
foundation to facilitate future researchers' investigation of the causal 
relationships between these variables.
