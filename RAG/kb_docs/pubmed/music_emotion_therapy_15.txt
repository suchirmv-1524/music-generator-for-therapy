BACKGROUND: Bronchoscopy is a fundamental diagnostic and therapeutic examination 
with rare complications which is often associated to anxiety and discomfort. The 
aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of music on anxiety levels among 
patients undergoing bronchoscopy in the pneumology department.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, investigator-blinded, 
controlled trial performed in two university hospitals. The patients were 
randomized into two groups: experimental group who had preselected classic 
Tunisian music during bronchoscopy and control group who had bronchoscopy 
without music. we assessed anxiety level using Spilberger's State Anxiety 
inventory (S-STAI) and comfort level using visual analogic scale (VAS). Vital 
signs and side effects during bronchoscopy were also assessed.
RESULTS: One hundred thirty-six patients were equally assigned into the two 
groups. the anxiety levels before and after bronchoscopy were similar into the 
two groups. The music had no effect on anxiety level using the S-STAI . There 
was no significant difference between the two groups regarding side effects and 
vital signs during bronchoscopy. There was a significant effect of music on mean 
change of VAS score (p = 0.018).
CONCLUSION: The music improved comfort level of patients undergoing 
bronchoscopy.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was retrospectively registered in the pan African 
Clinical Trial Registry with the trial number PACTR202309620440045 on 3 
September 2023.
