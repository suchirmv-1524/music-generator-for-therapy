In an earlier study, we analyzed how audio signals obtained from three 
professional opera singers varied when they sang one octave wide eight-tone 
scales in ten different emotional colors. The results showed systematic 
variations in voice source and long-term-average spectrum (LTAS) parameters 
associated with major emotion "families". For two of the singers, subglottal 
pressure (PSub) also was recorded, thus allowing analysis of an additional main 
physiological voice control parameter, glottal resistance (defined as the ratio 
between PSub and glottal flow), and related to glottal adduction. In the present 
study, we analyze voice source and LTAS parameters derived from the audio signal 
and their correlation with Psub and glottal resistance. The measured parameters 
showed a systematic relationship with the four emotion families observed in our 
previous study. They also varied systematically with values of the ten emotions 
along the valence, power, and arousal dimensions; valence showed a significant 
correlation with the ratio between acoustic voice source energy and subglottal 
pressure, while Power varied significantly with sound level and two measures 
related to the spectral dominance of the lowest spectrum partial. the 
fundamental.
