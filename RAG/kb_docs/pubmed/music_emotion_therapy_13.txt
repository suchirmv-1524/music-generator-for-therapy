INTRODUCTION: Cancer is currently the second most common cause of death 
worldwide and is often treated with chemotherapy. Music therapy is a widely used 
adjunct therapy offered in oncology settings to attenuate negative impacts of 
treatment on patient's physical and mental health; however, music therapy 
research during chemotherapy is relatively scarce. The aim of this study is to 
evaluate the impact of group music therapy sessions with patients and caregivers 
on their perceived anxiety, stress, and wellbeing levels and the perception of 
chemotherapy-induced side effects for patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study following the STROBE 
guidelines. From April to October 2022, 41 group music therapy sessions 
including 141 patients and 51 caregivers were conducted. Participants filled out 
pre- and post-intervention Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) assessing their anxiety, 
stress, and wellbeing levels, and for patients the intensity of 
chemotherapy-induced side effects.
RESULTS: The results show a statistically significant decrease of anxiety and 
stress levels (p < .001), an increase in well-being of patients and caregivers 
(p < .001, p = .009), and a decrease in patients' perceived intensity of 
chemotherapy-induced side effects (p = .003). Calculated effect sizes were 
moderate for anxiety, stress, and well-being levels, and small for 
chemotherapy-induced side effects.
DISCUSSION: This is the first study regarding group music therapy sessions for 
cancer patients and their caregivers during chemotherapy in Colombia. Music 
therapy has been found to be a valuable strategy to reduce psychological 
distress in this population and to provide opportunities for fostering self-care 
and social interaction.
CONCLUSIONS: Music therapy should be considered as a valuable complementary 
therapy during chemotherapy. However, it is crucial to conduct prospective 
studies with parallel group designs to confirm these preliminary findings.
