BACKGROUND: Research exploring emotional responses to math-related words in 
individuals with math anxiety (MA) is scarce. Here, we examined MA participants' 
subjective emotional processing of math-related cues within Lang's 
bioinformational model of emotion to further understand the role of those cues 
in MA.
METHODS: In total, 41 high-MA and 32 low-MA undergraduates rated math-related 
words, along with neutral, pleasant, and unpleasant words, from the Affective 
Norms for English Words. The Self-Assessment Manikin was used to calculate 
valence, arousal, and dominance scores for each word.
RESULTS: The low-MA group rated math-related words as neutral on the three 
emotional scales, however, the high-MA group rated them lower and higher for 
valence and dominance than neutral and unpleasant words, respectively. Moreover, 
math-related words were rated as more and less activating than neutral and 
unpleasant words, respectively. The two groups significantly differed in scores 
on the three scales only for the math-related words.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence that individuals with high MA show 
altered emotional processing of math-related words, experiencing them as 
moderately aversive and moderately activating. The findings emphasize that the 
altered emotional processing of words associated with math should be considered 
a symptom of MA.
