Characterized by its customary symbol system and simple and vivid expression 
patterns, cyber language acts as not only a tool for convenient communication 
but also a carrier of abundant emotions and causes high attention in public 
opinion analysis, internet marketing, service feedback monitoring, and social 
emergency management. Based on our multidisciplinary research, this paper 
presents a classification of the emotional symbols in cyber language, analyzes 
the cognitive characteristics of different symbols, and puts forward a mechanism 
model to show the dominant neural activities in that process. Through the 
comparative study of Chinese, English, and Spanish, which are used by the 
largest population in the world, this paper discusses the expressive patterns of 
emotions in international cyber languages and proposes an intelligent method for 
affective computing on cyber language in a unified PAD 
(Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance) emotional space.
