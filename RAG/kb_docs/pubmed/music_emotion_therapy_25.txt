BACKGROUND: Recovery constitutes the goal for people with alcohol use disorder 
(AUD). State hope and abstinence self-efficacy represent consequential 
constructs for people with AUD as they work toward recovery.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this two-group cluster-randomized single-session 
effectiveness study was to compare the effects of group motivational-educational 
songwriting (MESW) and group recreational music therapy (RMT) by measuring 
between- and within-group differences in measures of state hope and abstinence 
self-efficacy in adults with AUD on a detoxification unit.
METHOD: Participants (N = 86) were cluster-randomized to a single-session of 
group MESW or group RMT. Participants completed psychometric inventories 
measuring state hope (consisting of agency and pathways subscales as well as 
total state hope) and abstinence self-efficacy (consisting of temptation and 
confidence subscales) at pre- and posttest.
RESULTS: Analyses indicated statistically significant within-group changes in 
agency, pathways, total state hope, temptation, and confidence. In all measures, 
there were favorable changes from pre- to posttest. There were statistically 
significant between-group differences in pathways and total state hope, with the 
MESW condition outperforming the RMT condition.
CONCLUSION: A single group MESW or group RMT session can positively influence 
state hope and abstinence self-efficacy in adults with AUD on a detoxification 
unit. As the MESW condition explicitly addressed recovery, has other empirical 
support in the literature, and significantly outperformed the RMT condition in 
measures of pathways and total state hope, MESW may be an ideal intervention for 
adults in detoxification settings. Implications for practice, limitations, and 
suggestions for future research are provided.
