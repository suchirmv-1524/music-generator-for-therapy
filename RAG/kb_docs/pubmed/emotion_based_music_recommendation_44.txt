Music performance research is a comprehensive study of aspects such as emotional 
analysis and personalisation in music performance, which help to add richness 
and creativity to the art of music performance. The labels in this paper in 
collaborative annotation contain rich personalised descriptive information as 
well as item content information and can therefore be used to help provide 
better recommendations. The algorithm is based on bipartite graph node structure 
similarity and restarted random wandering. It analyses the connection between 
users, items, and tags in the music social network, firstly constructs the 
adjacency relationship between music and tags, obtains the music recommendation 
list and indirectly associated music collection, then fuses the results 
according to the proposed algorithm, and reorders them to obtain the final 
recommendation list, thus realising the personalised music recommendation 
algorithm. The experiments show that the proposed method can meet the 
personalised demand of users for music on this dataset.
