OBJECTIVES: Endodontic treatment is one of the most fearful procedures among 
dentistry, and the use of music during the procedure has been evaluated to 
control patients' anxiety. This systematic review has been conducted to provide 
a synthesis of the state of knowledge in this field and aimed to answer the 
following question: "Can music therapy reduce patient's state anxiety during 
endodontic treatment?".
METHODS: A search was performed in six electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane 
Library, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Open Gray) for articles published 
until April 2022. The eligibility criteria, based on the PICOS strategy, were as 
follows: (P) patients undergoing endodontic treatment; (I) exposure to music; 
(C) no music; (O) patients' anxiety; (S) only randomized clinical trials. The 
risk of bias was analyzed according to the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for 
randomized controlled trials (RoB 2). The strength of evidence from the included 
studies was assessed using the Grading of Assessment, Development, and 
Assessment Recommendations (GRADE) tool.
RESULTS: Five eligible studies were retrieved. A low to high risk of bias was 
verified. Descriptive analysis showed an effect in favor of music intervention, 
with differences among state anxiety, heart rate and blood pressure.
CONCLUSIONS: With a very low quality of evidence, dental care professionals may 
consider playing background music during endodontic treatment since it is a 
cost-effective and easy alternative to trying to reduce dental anxiety.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Five studies were included in this systematic review and 
showed, with a very low quality of evidence, that music may reduce state anxiety 
levels on patients during root canal treatment.
