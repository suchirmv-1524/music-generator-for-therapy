BACKGROUND: The protocol described in this paper is part of a research project 
coordinated between three Spanish universities, where a technology aimed at 
improving the quality of life of people with cerebral palsy will be developed. 
Part of the proposed technology will consist of an interface and a series of 
applications to increase motivation for daily physical activity. The basis of 
these developments is the measurement of the emotional state of the subjects.
METHODS: The experimental protocol is designed with two research objectives, on 
the one hand to identify the emotional state through physiological signals, and 
on the other to determine whether music can be a motivating factor to promote 
physical activity. It is specifically designed for subjects with cerebral palsy, 
taking into account the special characteristics of this population. These are 
people with whom it is difficult to use questionnaires to have a basis to 
contrast with the measured physiological signals, so measurements must be taken 
in carefully chosen daily-life situations.
DISCUSSION: We hope our findings show which physiological parameters are the 
most robust to measure the emotional state and how to design rehabilitation and 
physical activity promotion routines that are motivating, in addition to being 
able to avoid risk factors during the performance of these routines.
