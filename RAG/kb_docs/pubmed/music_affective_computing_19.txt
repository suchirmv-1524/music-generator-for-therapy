OBJECTIVES: To investigate if skin vibration employing consonant frequencies 
emitted by skin transducers attached to a combination of acupuncture points and 
according to musical harmony (musical chord) produces more significant pain 
relief compared to just a single frequency.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Skin vibrostimulation produced by five electromagnet 
transducers was applied at five acupoints traditionally used to pain relief and 
anxiety in 13 pain-free healthy volunteers using the cold pressor test (CPT). 
The study consisted of three randomized sessions conducted on alternate days, 
with participants receiving either simultaneous frequencies of 32, 48, and 64 Hz 
that equate those used in a musical chord, hereby defined as musical 
vibroacupuncture (MVA), a single frequency of 32 Hz, set as vibroacupuncture 
(VA) and sham procedure (SP). CPT scores for pain thresholds and pain tolerance 
were assessed using repeated-measures ANOVAs. Pain intensity was evaluated using 
a numerical rating scale (NRS), while sensory and affective aspects of pain were 
rated using the short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) and State-Trait 
Anxiety Inventory (STAI) Y-Form.
RESULTS: Pain thresholds did not vary significantly between trials. Pain 
tolerance scores were markedly higher in MVA compared to baseline (p = 0.0043) 
or SP (p = 0.006) but not for VA. Pain intensity for MVA also differed 
significantly from the baseline (p = 0.007) or SP (p = 0.027), but not for VA. 
No significant differences were found in SF-MPQ and STAI questionnaires.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that MVA effectively increased pain tolerance 
and reduced pain intensity when compared with all groups, although not 
significant to the VA group.
