AIM: The aim is to evaluate and compare the efficacy of sensory distractors in 
the management of anxious pediatric patients during dental treatment aged 
between 6 and 9 years.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 350 children were divided into five groups (70 
each): Group A: Visual distraction using distraction cards, Group B: Olfactory 
distraction using lemongrass oil aromatherapy, Group C: Auditory distraction 
through music therapy, Group D: Tactile distraction using Hugo acupressure, and 
Group E: Gustatory distraction using honey for taste. Each group received one of 
the sensory distraction interventions during dental treatment. Anxiety levels 
were assessed using the Chota Bheem Chutki Scale, pulse rate, and oxygen 
saturation (SpO2) before and after the procedure. Statistical analysis was 
performed using SPSS version 24, employing paired t-tests and one-way ANOVA to 
compare pre- and postintervention data.
RESULTS: All sensory distraction methods significantly reduced anxiety levels 
and improved SPO2 readings (P < 0.001). The auditory distraction group showed 
the greatest reduction in anxiety (mean change = 1.10) and the largest increase 
in SPO2 levels (mean change = -4.98). Visual distraction also demonstrated 
significant efficacy, notably reducing posttreatment anxiety (mean = 1.04). Both 
the auditory and visual groups were more effective compared to gustatory and 
olfactory methods.
CONCLUSION: Auditory distraction, particularly music, was the most effective in 
managing pediatric dental anxiety, followed by visual distraction. Sensory 
distractions are valuable nonpharmacological tools for reducing anxiety and 
improving physiological comfort in children undergoing dental procedures.
