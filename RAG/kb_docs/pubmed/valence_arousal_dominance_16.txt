A speech emotion recognition (SER) system deployed on a real-world application 
can encounter speech contaminated with unconstrained background noise. To deal 
with this issue, a speech enhancement (SE) module can be attached to the SER 
system to compensate for the environmental difference of an input. Although the 
SE module can improve the quality and intelligibility of a given speech, there 
is a risk of affecting discriminative acoustic features for SER that are 
resilient to environmental differences. Exploring this idea, we propose to 
enhance only weak features that degrade the emotion recognition performance. Our 
model first identifies weak feature sets by using multiple models trained with 
one acoustic feature at a time using clean speech. After training the 
single-feature models, we rank each speech feature by measuring three criteria: 
performance, robustness, and a joint rank ranking that combines performance and 
robustness. We group the weak features by cumulatively incrementing the features 
from the bottom to the top of each rank. Once the weak feature set is defined, 
we only enhance those weak features, keeping the resilient features unchanged. 
We implement these ideas with the low-level descriptors (LLDs). We show that 
directly enhancing the weak LLDs leads to better performance than extracting 
LLDs from an enhanced speech signal. Our experiment with clean and noisy 
versions of the MSP-Podcast corpus shows that the proposed approach yields a 
17.7% (arousal), 21.2% (dominance), and 3.3% (valence) performance gains over a 
system that enhances all the LLDs for the 10dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) 
condition.
