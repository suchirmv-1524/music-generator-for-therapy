Individual traits and habits have shown to be associated with health and health 
behaviour. One such habit is how individuals use music. This study aimed to 
examine if using music as a mood regulator is related to risk factors of 
lifestyle diseases. Participants who joined the present Motivation Makes the 
Move! lifestyle intervention were overweight and sedentary adults (n = 76, ages 
19-40). They answered questionnaires about physical activity and use of music. 
They also underwent a cardiopulmonary exercise test and their body composition 
was assessed. Additionally, the analyses' robustness was tested through 
controlling for physical, sociodemographic and psychological health related 
factors. We observed that despite the participants' self-reported commitment to 
regular physical activity, their fitness level was poor. Using music as a mood 
regulator was associated with lower cardiorespiratory fitness. Use of music was 
also positively linked to body fat percentage, although this finding did not 
remain significant after adjusting for age, educational level and experienced 
health. We urge future research to address the relationship between music use 
and risk factors of lifestyle diseases in a population sample.
