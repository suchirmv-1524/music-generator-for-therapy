AIM: In a previous study, we reported that watching two-dimensional videos of 
earthquakes significantly reduced sympathetic nerve activity in healthy young 
adults. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the emotional responses to 
earthquakes using immersive virtual reality (VR), which can provide a more 
realistic experience.
METHODS: In total, 24 healthy young adults (12 males, 21.4 ± 0.2 years old) 
participated. Participants were required to watch earthquake and neutral videos 
while wearing a head-mounted display and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), 
during which physiological signals, including pulse rate and cerebral blood flow 
(CBF) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, were measured. We also analyzed 
changes in sympathetic and parasympathetic indices and obtained seven emotion 
ratings: valence, arousal, dominance, fear, astonishment, anxiety, and panic.
RESULTS: The VR earthquake videos evoked negative subjective emotions, and the 
pulse rate significantly decreased. Sympathetic nerve activity tended to 
decrease, whereas CBF in the left prefrontal cortex showed a slight increase, 
although this was not significant.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that measurements combined with NIRS and 
immersive VR have the potential to capture emotional responses to different 
stimuli.
