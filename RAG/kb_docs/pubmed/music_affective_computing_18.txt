As COVID-19 solidifies its presence in everyday life, the interest in mental 
health is growing, resulting in the necessity of sentiment analysis. A smart 
mirror is suitable for encouraging mental comfort due to its approachability and 
scalability as an in-home AI device. From the aspect of natural language 
processing (NLP), sentiment analysis for Korean lacks an emotion dataset 
regarding everyday conversation. Its significant differences from English in 
terms of language structure make implementation challenging. The proposed smart 
mirror LUX provides Korean text sentiment analysis with the deep learning model, 
which examines GRU, LSTM, CNN, Bi-LSTM, and Bi-GRU networks. There are four 
emotional labels: anger, sadness, neutral, and happiness. For each emotion, 
there are three possible interactive responses: reciting wise sayings, playing 
music, and sympathizing. The implemented smart mirror also includes more-typical 
functions, such as a wake-up prompt, a weather reporting function, a calendar, a 
news reporting function, and a clock.
