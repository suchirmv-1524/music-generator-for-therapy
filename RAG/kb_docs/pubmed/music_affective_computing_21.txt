Music provides a means of communicating affective meaning. However, the 
neurological mechanisms by which music induces affect are not fully understood. 
Our project sought to investigate this through a series of experiments into how 
humans react to affective musical stimuli and how physiological and neurological 
signals recorded from those participants change in accordance with self-reported 
changes in affect. In this paper, the datasets recorded over the course of this 
project are presented, including details of the musical stimuli, participant 
reports of their felt changes in affective states as they listened to the music, 
and concomitant recordings of physiological and neurological activity. We also 
include non-identifying meta data on our participant populations for purposes of 
further exploratory analysis. This data provides a large and valuable novel 
resource for researchers investigating emotion, music, and how they affect our 
neural and physiological activity.
