BACKGROUND: Emotions play a crucial role in people's lives, profoundly affecting 
their cognition, decision-making, and interpersonal communication. Emotion 
recognition based on brain signals has become a significant challenge in the 
fields of affective computing and human-computer interaction.
METHODS: Addressing the issue of inaccurate feature extraction and low accuracy 
of existing deep learning models in emotion recognition, this paper proposes a 
multi-channel automatic classification model for emotion EEG signals named DACB, 
which is based on dual attention mechanisms, convolutional neural networks, and 
bidirectional long short-term memory networks. DACB extracts features in both 
temporal and spatial dimensions, incorporating not only convolutional neural 
networks but also SE attention mechanism modules for learning the importance of 
different channel features, thereby enhancing the network's performance. DACB 
also introduces dot product attention mechanisms to learn the importance of 
spatial and temporal features, effectively improving the model's accuracy.
RESULTS: The accuracy of this method in single-shot validation tests on the 
SEED-IV and DREAMER (Valence-Arousal-Dominance three-classification) datasets is 
99.96% and 87.52%, 90.06%, and 89.05%, respectively. In 10-fold cross-validation 
tests, the accuracy is 99.73% and 84.26%, 85.40%, and 85.02%, outperforming 
other models.
CONCLUSIONS: This demonstrates that the DACB model achieves high accuracy in 
emotion classification tasks, demonstrating outstanding performance and 
generalization ability and providing new directions for future research in EEG 
signal recognition.
