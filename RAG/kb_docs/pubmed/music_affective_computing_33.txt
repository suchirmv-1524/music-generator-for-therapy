In the past decades, neuroimaging of humans has gained a position of status 
within neuroscience, and data-driven approaches and functional connectivity 
analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data are increasingly 
favored to depict the complex architecture of human brains. However, the 
reliability of these findings is jeopardized by too many analysis methods and 
sometimes too few samples used, which leads to discord among researchers. We 
propose a tunable consensus clustering paradigm that aims at overcoming the 
clustering methods selection problem as well as reliability issues in 
neuroimaging by means of first applying several analysis methods (three in this 
study) on multiple datasets and then integrating the clustering results. To 
validate the method, we applied it to a complex fMRI experiment involving 
affective processing of hundreds of music clips. We found that brain structures 
related to visual, reward, and auditory processing have intrinsic spatial 
patterns of coherent neuroactivity during affective processing. The comparisons 
between the results obtained from our method and those from each individual 
clustering algorithm demonstrate that our paradigm has notable advantages over 
traditional single clustering algorithms in being able to evidence robust 
connectivity patterns even with complex neuroimaging data involving a variety of 
stimuli and affective evaluations of them. The consensus clustering method is 
implemented in the R package "UNCLES" available on 
http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/UNCLES/index.html .
