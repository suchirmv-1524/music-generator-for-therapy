BACKGROUND: Anxiety may adversely impact mother and her newborn. Music listening 
is a safe and efficacious treatment that may to reduce perioperative anxiety. 
The effect on acute pain and pain catastrophizing scores remains unclear. We 
aimed to determine whether perioperative music listening reduces anxiety, acute 
pain, and pain catastrophizing scale (PCS) scores following elective cesarean 
delivery under spinal anesthesia.
METHODS: After randomization into music listening and control groups, baseline 
patient characteristics, visual analog scale-anxiety (VAS-A) scores, pain 
scores, PCS total and sub-scores, and music preferences were collected 
preoperatively. Before surgery, parturients in the experimental group listened 
to music of their own choice for 30 min. Music listening was continued during 
administration of spinal anesthesia and cesarean delivery, and for 30 min 
following surgery. Postoperative VAS-A score, acute pain score, PCS scores, 
music preferences, satisfaction score, and feedback were recorded.
RESULTS: We analyzed 108 parturients (music: n = 53; control: n = 55). Music 
listening was associated with reduced postoperative VAS-A (mean difference (MD) 
-1.43, 95%CI -0.63 to -2.22), PCS total score (MD -6.39, 95%CI -2.11 to -10.66), 
PCS sub-scores on rumination (MD -1.68, 95%CI -0.12 to -3.25), magnification (MD 
-1.53, 95%CI -0.45 to -2.62), and helplessness (MD -3.17, 95%CI -1.29 to -5.06) 
sub-scores. There was no significant difference in postoperative acute pain 
scores. The majority (> 95%) of parturients reported "excellent" and "good" 
satisfaction with music listening, and most provided positive feedback.
CONCLUSION: Perioperative music listening was associated with reduced 
postoperative anxiety and lower pain catastrophizing. Based on the good patient 
satisfaction and positive feedback received, the use of music listening in the 
obstetric setting is recommended.
