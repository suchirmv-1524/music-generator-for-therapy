AIMS: To evaluate the effects of passive music listening combined with 
progressive muscle relaxation on anxiety, depression, stress, coping, and 
quality-of-life in women with breast and gynaecological cancers receiving 
chemotherapy.
METHODS: This was an assessor-blinded, randomised wait-list controlled trial. A 
total of 120 participants were randomly allocated into an intervention group or 
a wait-list control group. The intervention group received an intervention 
comprising training on passive music listening and progressive muscle 
relaxation, with once-daily self-practice at home for 3 weeks. The wait-list 
control group received the same intervention after the outcome assessment at 
week 6. All outcome data were collected before (T0) and 3 weeks (T1), 6 weeks 
(T2), and 12 months (T3) after randomisation. A generalised estimating equations 
model was used to compare the changes in each outcome at different time points. 
Process evaluation was conducted using data from the patient's self-report forms 
and interviews.
RESULTS: The findings indicated that at T1 and T2, the intervention group's 
reductions in anxiety were significantly larger than those of the control group. 
Additionally, the intervention group exhibited significantly better decreases in 
depression at T2, stress at T1, and dysfunctional coping at T2, and a greater 
improvement in quality-of-life score at T1 and T2 when compared to the control 
group. Most of the interviewed participants provided positive feedback on the 
intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: The intervention was beneficial for lowering anxiety, depression, 
and stress and increasing the quality-of-life of women receiving chemotherapy 
for breast and gynaecological cancers.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was prospectively registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov on 9 February 2022 (registration number: NCT05262621).
