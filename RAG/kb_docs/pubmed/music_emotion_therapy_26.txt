BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are common in children and among the most 
prevalent psychiatric issues. Untreated preoperative anxiety can lead to 
increased complications and a higher risk for future anxiety disorders and major 
depression. Therefore, addressing preoperative anxiety in children is crucial to 
prevent perioperative and long-term adverse effects.
OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to evaluate various articles and develop a 
management plan based on evidence for the prevention of preoperative anxiety in 
children using non-pharmacological approaches in areas with limited resources.
METHODS: This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol. 
Databases, such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar, were searched 
for high-quality evidence to draw appropriate conclusions.
RESULT: A total of 7669 articles were retrieved from the search engines. These 
articles were then filtered based on intervention, outcome, population data, 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, and methodological quality. After the 
filtration process, only 35 studies met the inclusion criteria for comprehensive 
review.
CONCLUSION: The Children's Emotional Manifestation Scale (CEMS) effectively 
assesses preoperative anxiety in children. Evidence suggests that 
non-pharmacological interventions such as clowning, music therapy, audiovisuals, 
virtual reality, and cognitive-behavioral therapy are effective in preventing 
preoperative anxiety. Practitioners can choose a suitable non-pharmacological 
approach based on availability and cost.
