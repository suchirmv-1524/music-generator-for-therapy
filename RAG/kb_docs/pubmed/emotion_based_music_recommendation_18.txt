INTRODUCTION: The abundant functions of music and its effects on human's mental 
and physical health have been verified since ancient times, but rarely received 
attention as an alternative obstetric intervention.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the benefits of music therapy on 
prenatal and delivery experiences of pregnant women.
METHOD: A systematic search for articles was conducted in electronic databases 
including CINAHL, Web of Science, PubMed/Medline, and CNKI. A total of 240 
articles were identified, and 17 studies were selected for this review. The 
extracted data included author, year, location, sample size, intervention phase, 
type of music, music therapy strategy, measuring instruments, and results. The 
data were organized chronologically based on the publication year of each study.
RESULT: The articles indicated that music therapy has advantages in reducing 
pain during childbirth, lowering anxiety and stress levels in mothers, improving 
sleep quality, and increasing fetal movements, basal fetal heart rate, and 
accelerations.
CONCLUSION: Based on the findings, it can be concluded that music therapy is an 
effective approach to enhance the experience of pregnant women during pregnancy 
and delivery. Therefore, its implementation in obstetrical clinical practice is 
highly recommended.
