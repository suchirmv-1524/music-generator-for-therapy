BACKGROUND: The creative arts have long been known for their therapeutic 
potential. These modalities, which include dance, painting, and music, among 
others, appear to be effective in enhancing emotional expression and alleviating 
adverse physiological and psychological effects. Engagement in creative arts can 
be pursued as a personal hobby, in a classroom setting, or through a formal 
therapeutic intervention with a qualified therapist. Engagement can be active 
(i.e., creating) or passive (i.e., viewing, listening). Regardless of the 
modality and manner of engagement, the mechanisms explaining the therapeutic 
efficacy of creative arts remain poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to systematically review research investigating the 
neurological mechanisms activated during active or passive engagement in 
creative arts, with a specific emphasis on the roles of the medial prefrontal 
cortex (mPFC) and the amygdala in emotional regulation (ER) and creative 
behaviors. The review seeks to provide preliminary evidence for the possible 
existence of common neural mechanisms underlying both phenomena, which could 
inform the development of targeted therapeutic interventions leveraging creative 
arts for ER.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted following the Cochrane Collaboration 
guideline and PRISMA standards to identify studies examining the neurological 
mechanisms underlying creative activities.
RESULTS: A total of six out of 85 records meet the inclusion criteria, with all 
being basic research studies. Preliminary findings suggest that active and 
passive engagement with creative arts consistently activate neural circuits 
implicated in adaptive emotional regulation, including the mPFC and amygdala. 
These activations mirror the neural pathways engaged in effective ER strategies, 
suggesting the possible existence of shared mechanisms between creative 
expression and emotional processing.
CONCLUSION: The evidence underscores the potential of creative arts as a 
complementary therapeutic strategy alongside conventional care and other 
evidence-based mind-body modalities. By elucidating the shared neural mechanisms 
between creative arts engagement and ER, this review contributes to the 
theoretical and practical understanding of the role of creative arts in mental 
health. Future research is recommended to further explore these neural 
correlations and their implications for therapeutic practice.
