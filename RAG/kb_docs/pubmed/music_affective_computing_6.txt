This paper presents novel preliminary research that investigates the 
relationship between the flow of a group of jazz musicians, quantified through 
multi-person pose synchronization, and their collective emotions. We have 
developed a real-time software to calculate the physical synchronicity of team 
members by tracking the difference in arm, leg, and head movements using 
Lightweight OpenPose. We employ facial expression recognition to evaluate the 
musicians' collective emotions. Through correlation and regression analysis, we 
establish that higher levels of synchronized body and head movements correspond 
to lower levels of disgust, anger, sadness, and higher levels of joy among the 
musicians. Furthermore, we utilize 1-D CNNs to predict the collective emotions 
of the musicians. The model leverages 17 body synchrony keypoint vectors as 
features, resulting in a training accuracy of 61.47% and a test accuracy of 
66.17%.
