The response of older people to the COVID-19 pandemic has attracted much 
attention as they are at increased risk of adverse outcomes. A longitudinal 
study has shown that improvement in global cognitive, executive and language 
functioning in healthy older adults enrolled at the University of the Third Age 
appears to play a protective role against emotional dysregulation and mood 
changes during the pandemic. To date, no study has examined emotional 
dysregulation through COVID-19-related images using facial electromyographic 
recordings in healthy older adults. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the 
relationships between zygomaticus and corrugator reactivity, neuropsychological 
measures, and the affective dimensions of arousal, dominance, and valence. The 
results showed an unexpected association between higher zygomaticus activity and 
higher levels of apathy, depression, and anxiety. In contrast, increased 
contracture of the corrugator was associated with poorer performance on 
cognitive tests (global cognition, memory, executive functions) and physical 
status, i.e., walking speed. These results are consistent with the reappraisal 
of emotional stimuli in response to the challenges of the pandemic. 
Interestingly, COVID-19-related stimuli triggered the activation of bottom-up 
affectivity strategies associated with higher mood levels and interacted with 
top-down factors that play an important role in the dysregulation of cognitive 
control.
