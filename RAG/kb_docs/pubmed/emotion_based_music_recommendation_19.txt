BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common in military veterans 
and presents as distress, anxiety, or depression due to a traumatic event. 
Expressive therapies are an emerging intervention used to enhance the quality of 
life by addressing the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral aspects of 
individuals.
METHODS: Five databases were searched from 2014 to 2022 with search terms 
addressing the expressive therapies of art, dance, drama, music, and writing, 
and military veterans with PTSD.
RESULTS: One hundred eighty-seven articles were screened and 16 articles 
qualified for review. Articles were categorized based on the following results: 
decrease in PTSD symptoms, veterans' triggered responses, participants 
recommending expressive therapy/finding it helpful, and increased well-being 
and/or quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Results found that expressive therapies are effective in reducing 
PTSD symptoms in military veterans. However, more research is recommended to 
fully support the use of expressive therapies in PTSD treatment.
