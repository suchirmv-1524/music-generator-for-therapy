Social networks can provide insights into the emotions expressed by a society. 
However, the dynamic nature of emotions presents a significant challenge for 
policymakers, politicians, and communication professionals who seek to 
understand and respond to changes in emotions over time. To address this 
challenge, this paper investigates the frequency, duration, and transition of 24 
distinct emotions over a 2-year period, analyzing more than 5 million tweets. 
The study shows that emotions with lower valence but higher dominance and/or 
arousal are more prevalent in online social networks. Emotions with higher 
valence and arousal tend to last longer, while dominant emotions tend to have 
shorter durations. Emotions occupying the conversations predominantly inhibit 
others with similar valence and dominance, and higher arousal. Over a month, 
emotions with similar valences tend to prevail in online social network 
conversations.
