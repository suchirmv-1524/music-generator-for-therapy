AIM: Musical interventions for hospitalized patients have shown benefits such as 
improved mood and reduced stress, but their impact from a qualitative 
perspective is under-explored. This study aimed to understand the experiences, 
perceptions, and emotions of chronically ill hospitalized patients who 
participated in a program of individual micro-concerts during their hospital 
stay.
METHODOLOGY: A qualitative study was conducted in a hospital in Bilbao, Spain, 
in 2024. Hospitalized patients were offered 20-minute micro-concerts three times 
a week. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 patients selected 
through purposive sampling. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed 
inductively to identify thematic patterns.
RESULTS: The analysis identified four categories. The first was emotional and 
cognitive well-being, where patients reported improvements in mood and cognitive 
stimulation. The second category, the operational aspects of the intervention, 
highlighted the positive perception of the frequency, duration, and 
personalization of the sessions. The third category was personal evaluation, 
where the role of the music therapist was highlighted as a key factor in the 
success of the intervention. Finally, suggestions for improvement included 
recommendations to extend the program to other areas of the hospital and combine 
musical interventions with complementary activities.
CONCLUSIONS: Personalized musical interventions have a positive impact on the 
emotional and cognitive well-being of patients. It is essential to design 
flexible interventions that adapt to individual needs and promote integrated 
care models.
