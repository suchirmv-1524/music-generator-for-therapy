BACKGROUND: Bereaved parents have significantly higher morbidity and mortality 
than non-bereaved parents. Despite national guidelines recommending bereavement 
care, resources for bereaved parents are scarce. Most intervention studies lack 
empirical evidence of effectiveness or alignment with key theoretical concepts.
AIMS: To evaluate the feasibility of a 6-week intervention with parents of 
children who have died from cancer. Storytelling Through Music (STM) combines 
multiple modalities of expression (storytelling, reflective writing, 
songwriting) and psychoeducation to facilitate loss- and restoration-oriented 
coping by creating a legacy piece (self-written story paired with a song) to 
help bereaved parents adapt to a life-long process of finding meaning after 
loss.
METHODS: Two-group, randomized controlled trial, utilizing multiple methods. 
Participants were randomized to STM or waitlist control. The intervention is 
delivered online and in a group setting. Descriptive statistics were used for 
feasibility data, content analysis to evaluate open-ended acceptability 
questions, and RM ANOVA to evaluate the differences between psychosocial, 
coping, and grief outcomes.
RESULTS: Twenty-three parents were enrolled. Average age was (range: 32-68) and 
the child's average age was 18.9 (range: 1.5-35). This study indicates that the 
online delivery of STM is feasible and acceptable and provides preliminary 
evidence of reducing prolonged grief and loneliness.
CONCLUSIONS: STM is a theoretically driven, innovative approach to addressing 
grief in a high-risk, underserved population. Findings suggest STM can be 
delivered online and is acceptable to participants. Adding music to storytelling 
and reflective writing provides a unique expression and preliminary data 
suggests improvements in psychosocial well-being, coping, and grief intensity.
