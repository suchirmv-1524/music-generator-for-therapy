INTRODUCTION: Depression and its components significantly impact dementia 
prediction and severity, necessitating reliable objective measures for 
quantification.
METHODS: We investigated associations between emotion-based speech measures 
(valence, arousal, and dominance) during picture descriptions and depression 
dimensions derived from the geriatric depression scale (GDS, dysphoria, 
withdrawal-apathy-vigor (WAV), anxiety, hopelessness, and subjective memory 
complaint).
RESULTS: Higher WAV was associated with more negative valence 
(estimate = -0.133, p = 0.030). While interactions of apolipoprotein E (APOE) 4 
status with depression dimensions on emotional valence did not reach 
significance, there was a trend for more negative valence with higher dysphoria 
in those with at least one APOE4 allele (estimate = -0.404, p = 0.0846). 
Associations were similar irrespective of dementia severity.
DISCUSSION: Our study underscores the potential utility of speech biomarkers in 
characterizing depression dimensions. In future research, using emotionally 
charged stimuli may enhance emotional measure elicitation. The role of APOE on 
the interaction of speech markers and depression dimensions warrants further 
exploration with greater sample sizes.
HIGHLIGHTS: Participants reporting higher apathy used more negative words to 
describe a neutral picture.Those with higher dysphoria and at least one APOE4 
allele also tended to use more negative words.Our results suggest the potential 
use of speech biomarkers in characterizing depression dimensions.
