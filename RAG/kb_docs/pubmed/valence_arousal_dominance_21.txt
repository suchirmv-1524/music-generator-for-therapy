Emotion recognition based on Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been applied in 
various fields, including human-computer interaction and healthcare. However, 
for the popular Valence-Arousal-Dominance emotion model, researchers often 
classify the dimensions into high and low categories, which cannot reflect 
subtle changes in emotion. Furthermore, there are issues with the design of EEG 
features and the efficiency of transformer. To address these issues, we have 
designed TPRO-NET, a neural network that takes differential entropy and enhanced 
differential entropy features as input and outputs emotion categories through 
convolutional layers and improved transformer encoders. For our experiments, we 
categorized the emotions in the DEAP dataset into 8 classes and those in the 
DREAMER dataset into 5 classes. On the DEAP and the DREAMER datasets, TPRO-NET 
achieved average accuracy rates of 97.63%/97.47%/97.88% and 
98.18%/98.37%/98.40%, respectively, on the Valence/Arousal/Dominance dimension 
for the subject-dependent experiments. Compared to other advanced methods, 
TPRO-NET demonstrates superior performance.
