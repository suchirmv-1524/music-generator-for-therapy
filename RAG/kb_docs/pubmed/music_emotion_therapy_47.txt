BACKGROUND: Music can be used in the perioperative period as a 
nonpharmacological intervention to reduce anxiety, but how long it should be 
played to be effective is unknown. The goal of this study was to determine the 
95% effective duration (ED95) of music of different subtypes for anxiolysis in 
parturients awaiting elective cesarean delivery. It was hypothesized that the 
overall ED95 would be <15 minutes and similar between music groups.
METHODS: A prospective, randomized, biased coin study was conducted at a major 
academic institution. Consented parturients undergoing elective cesarean 
delivery were randomly assigned to one of 2 music groups: preselected Mozart 
sonatas or patient preference. Music duration began at 4 minutes and was 
subsequently increased, decreased, or kept the same based on the previous 
subject's response. Anxiety on a verbal scale of 0 to 10 and vital signs were 
compared pre-and postmusic. Successful intervention was defined as a decrease in 
anxiety by at least 1 point. Primary ED95 estimates with centered isotonic 
regressions (CIRs) were compared utilizing 83% confidence intervals (CI), while 
turning-point and simple means were compared with Student's t tests for 
sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 57 pregnant women were approached and 40 agreed to 
participate. The mean age was 33 (standard deviation [SD] 5.1). Primary ED95 
estimates by CIR were 6.8 (83% CI, 5.9-8.4) minutes and 6.7 (83% CI, 5.9-8.3) 
minutes for Mozart and personal preference music, respectively. Mean ED95 by CIR 
for any music type was 6.8 minutes. Mean immediate postintervention anxiety 
reduction with Mozart music was 1.7 (SD 1.4) and personal preference was 2.6 (SD 
2.0). There were no significant changes in heart rate or blood pressure 
immediately after music.
CONCLUSIONS: Playing music for <7 minutes is a versatile, effective, and 
low-risk method for anxiolysis in women awaiting elective cesarean delivery.
