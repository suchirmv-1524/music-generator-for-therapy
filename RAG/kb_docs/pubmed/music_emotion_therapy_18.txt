BACKGROUND: Intrauterine insemination (IUI) also found that this experience was 
associated with anxiety. Therefore, measures must be taken to reduce or 
eliminate the pain and anxiety associated with it.
OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the effect of virtual reality glasses (VRG) 
and therapeutic touch (TT) on pain, anxiety and satisfaction during intrauterine 
insemination.
METHODS: A single blind randomized controlled trial design was used. Patients 
were randomized into three groups: the virtual reality group (VRG, n = 32), the 
therapeutic touch group (TT, n = 32), and the control group (CG, n = 32). The 
study was conducted between January and June 2022 in the obstetric outpatient 
clinics of a public hospital in northern Türkiye. Anxiety was evaluated using 
the State Anxiety Inventory. Pain, and satisfaction were evaluated using the 
Visual Analogue Scale [VAS]. "The study used non-parametric tests for its 
statistics."
RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the pain level of the VRG group 
during IUI was lower than those of CG 3.7 ± 2.7 and TT 3.6 ± 2.9 (p = 0.01). 
Women were most satisfied with the TT application 9.2 ± 1.1 in the IUI procedure 
(p = 0.000). Anxiety levels after IUI were lower in the TT 43.0 ± 4.2 and VRG 
43.9 ± 4.4 than in CG 49.9 ± 4.0 (p = 0.000).
CONCLUSION: VRG application was effective in reducing pain associated with IUI 
procedure in women. Although the use of VRG with music reduced the pain 
associated with IUI more than the TT application, the women left the TT 
application satisfied.
