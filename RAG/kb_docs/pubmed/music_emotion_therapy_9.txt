Subthreshold Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) can complicate depression treatment 
as ASD may hinder treatment benefits. In this case, a patient in treatment for 
recurring depression with traits of ASD showed symptom reduction, improved 
relational functioning, and emotion regulation skills by combining 
pharmacotherapy and music therapy.
