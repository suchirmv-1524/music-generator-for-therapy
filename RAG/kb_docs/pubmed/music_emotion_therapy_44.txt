OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the effects of short-term music therapy 
on primiparas' negative emotions and quality of life.
METHODS: In this study, 101 pregnant women awaiting delivery in the obstetric 
department of the hospital from January 2022 to January 2023 were 
retrospectively analysed. Eleven pregnant women did not fulfil the inclusion 
criteria, resulting in the inclusion of 90 pregnant women. The control group had 
45 pregnant women admitted from January to July 2022, while the observation 
group had 45 pregnant women admitted from August 2022 to January 2023. The 
stress index, anxiety, depression, delivery and quality of life were compared 
between the two groups.
RESULTS: Upon admission, no significant differences were observed between the 
two groups in terms of stress index, self-anxiety scale (SAS) score, 
self-depression scale (SDS) score and quality of life (P > 0.05). During the 
second stage of labour, the levels of renin, epinephrine and norepinephrine were 
significantly lower in the study group than in the control group (P < 0.05). 
Furthermore, the study group exhibited lower SAS and SDS scores than the control 
group (P < 0.001). Notably, the total labour time was significantly shorter in 
the study group than in the control group (P < 0.05), but no significant 
difference was found between two groups in terms of bleeding 2 hours after 
delivery (P > 0.05). The 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) scores of the 
study group were significantly higher than those of the control group (P < 
0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Short-term music therapy can reduce the stress response of 
primiparas, relieve their anxiety and depression, shorten the total labour 
process and improve their quality of life.
