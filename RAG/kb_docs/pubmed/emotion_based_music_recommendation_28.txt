BACKGROUND: Growing evidence suggests that community-based interventions may be 
effective for anxiety and depression. This study aimed to describe studies of 
community interventions delivered to adults and/or young people, either in 
person or online, evaluated in randomised controlled trials and provide an 
indication as to their effectiveness, acceptability, quality of data and where 
possible, mechanisms of action. We included interventions delivered at and/or by 
museums, art galleries, libraries, gardens, music groups/choirs and sports 
clubs.
METHOD: We developed and followed a preregistered protocol: PROSPERO 
CRD42020204471. Randomised controlled trials in adults and young people were 
identified in an extensive search with no date/time, language, document type and 
publication status limitations. Studies were selected according to predetermined 
eligibility criteria and data independently extracted and then assessed using 
Risk of Bias 1. The studies were deemed too heterogeneous for meta-analysis and 
were therefore reported using a narrative synthesis.
RESULTS: Our analysis included 31 studies, with 2898 participants. Community 
interventions most studied in randomised controlled trials were community music 
(12 studies, 1432 participants), community exercise (14 studies, 955 
participants) and community gardens/gardening (6 studies, 335 participants). The 
majority of studies were from high-income countries - many were in specific 
populations (such as those with physical health problems) and were generally of 
low quality. Dropout rates across the included studies were low (1 participant 
on average per 100 participants). The inadequate description of interventions 
limited identification of potential mechanisms of action.
DISCUSSION: The uncertainty of the evidence allows only a weak recommendation in 
support of community interventions for anxiety and depression. The results 
suggest community engagement is a promising area for wide-reaching interventions 
to be implemented and evaluated, but more high-quality trials are needed, 
especially in young people and under-represented communities.
