OBJECTIVES: Music therapy can be a harmonising hope for cancer patients under 
palliative care to overcome fear, anxiety, anger, depression, pain and the range 
of emotional responses. Music therapists contribute to a comprehensive approach 
to providing holistic, patient-centred care to mainstream medical treatment. 
Hence, the study aims to understand the clinical impact of music therapy in 
cancer pain and palliative care.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: After approval from the Institutional Review Committee 
and getting informed consent, a total of 102 individual music therapy sessions 
were conducted for 43 patients with cancer hospitalised under palliative care. 
Each patient received an average of 2-4 music therapy sessions by a certified 
music therapist. Music therapy sessions were based on clinician referrals, 
hospitalisation status and musicality profile. Pain scores, anxiety scores, mood 
scores and intrinsic and extrinsic motivation levels were evaluated using a 
visual analogue scale before and immediately after the sessions. Data were 
statistically analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 
version 26.
RESULTS: The study indicates that cancer patients undergoing pain and palliative 
care experienced notable outcomes from music therapy sessions, including a 
significant decrease in anxiety and pain perception, along with enhancements in 
mood and motivation (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: To sum up, the ongoing study and understanding of the impact of 
music therapy underscore its meaningful and promising role in improving the 
overall quality of life for cancer patients within a holistic care approach.
