BACKGROUND: Anxiety is a common and significant problem in patients who need to 
undergo colonoscopy. However, the question of which non-pharmacological 
intervention is the best strategy to reduce anxiety in patients undergoing 
colonoscopy remains unanswered.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate and rank the effectiveness of various 
non-pharmacological interventions for reducing anxiety in patients undergoing 
colonoscopy in order to identify the most effective strategies.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, and 
Medline for randomized controlled trials published from the database 
construction to March 2024. The primary outcome was the difference between pre- 
and post-intervention anxiety means. A network meta-analysis was conducted 
utilizing the "gemtc" package based on R4.3.0.
RESULTS: The analysis encompassed 24 randomized controlled trials, incorporating 
2525 participants and evaluating 9 non-pharmacological interventions. All 
non-pharmacological interventions reduced anxiety in patients undergoing 
colonoscopy compared to standard care, with music intervention (SMD = -0.52, 
95 %CI (-0.84,-0.20)), audiovisual distraction (SMD = -0.54, 
95 %CI(-0.96,-0.12)), video information (SMD = -1.47, 95 %CI(-2.03,-0.90)), 
individual education (SMD = -1.72, 95 %CI(-2.76,-0.70)), and electroacupuncture 
(SMD = -1.12, 95 %CI(-2.10,-0.13)) having statistically significant effects. 
SUCRA ranking identified the priority of individual education (SUCRA: 92.5 %) 
and video information (SUCRA: 87.7 %). Meta-regression and sensitivity analysis 
further demonstrated the stability of the evidence. The certainty of the 
evidence was mostly rated as medium to low.
CONCLUSION: This review highlights the superior effects of individual education 
and video information in reducing anxiety in patients undergoing colonoscopy. 
The findings of our review could provide clinical decision-makers and healthcare 
practitioners, such as doctors and nurses, with evidence-based practices for 
selecting interventions to reduce anxiety in patients undergoing colonoscopy.
