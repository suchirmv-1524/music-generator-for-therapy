INTRODUCTION: There are established benefits of patient-selected music during 
conventional skin surgery, but a lack of evidence for laser procedures. Aims of 
this study were to assess whether patient-selected music during fractional 
ablative laser procedures enhances the patient experience, reduces perception of 
pain and anxiety, and impacts whether the patient would recommend the treatment 
to others and choose the treatment again.
METHODS: Patients were 18 or over, receiving ablative fractional carbon dioxide 
laser treatment for any cause. Patients were offered to select the music played 
during their treatment and then asked to fill in a feedback questionnaire post 
treatment.
RESULTS: A significant majority of 83.3% reported that the music enhanced their 
experience compared to previous treatments or compared to what they expected 
(25/30, p < .001). Music also significantly improved the likelihood that 
patients would recommend the treatment to others (n = 14, p < .05).
CONCLUSION: Music significantly enhances the experience of patients undergoing 
ablative fractional carbon dioxide laser resurfacing and increases the 
likelihood they will recommend the treatment to others. This appears to be 
independent of any perceived change in levels of pain or anxiety.
