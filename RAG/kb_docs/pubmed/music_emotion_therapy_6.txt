BACKGROUND: Music- and dance-based rehabilitation has gained prominence in 
promoting social engagement and improving motor, cognitive, and mood domains in 
individuals affected by different neurological disorders.
AIM: This systematic review aims to synthesize existing evidence from randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) investigating neuroimaging-based structural and 
functional neuroplasticity following music- and dance-based interventions among 
people with neurological disorders.
METHODS: Literature research was performed using PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, and 
Web of Science (WOS). A multidimensional approach was employed to assess the 
efficacy of music- and dance-based interventions, integrating neuroimaging and 
clinical assessments.
RESULTS: Out of a total of 2247 papers reviewed, 20 RCTs met the inclusion 
criteria for this review, with a total of 718 subjects. Among them, 88% 
underwent a neuroimaging investigation to evaluate structural or functional 
neuroplasticity. Six studies involved dance-based interventions, while 14 
examined music-based rehabilitation. These interventions targeted cognitive, 
motor, and mood impairments in people at risk of dementia or with neurological 
disorders including Huntington's Disease, stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal 
cord injury, and disorder of consciousness.
DISCUSSION: Overall, the selected studies demonstrated significant effects on 
behavioral and neuroimaging outcomes, showing structural and functional changes 
in critical areas for perception and memory in patients at risk of dementia, as 
well as in regions essential for language processing, emotional regulation, and 
motor control in patients with acute and chronic stroke. Nevertheless, several 
biases were identified, specifically related to neuroimaging biomarkers, such as 
a lack of baseline and between-group comparisons and a lack of prior 
registration of neuroimaging biomarkers investigated. The protocol of this 
review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic 
Reviews (PROSPERO), with registration number CRD42024574754.
