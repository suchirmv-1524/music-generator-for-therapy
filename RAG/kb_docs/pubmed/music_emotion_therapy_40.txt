OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of hypnosis or music intervention in 
alleviating distressing symptoms in critically ill patients facing extended or 
challenging liberation from mechanical ventilation (MV).
STUDY DESIGN: Single-center, prospective interventional trial.
METHODS: Critically ill patients experiencing extended or challenging MV weaning 
were assigned to either a hypnosis group or a music intervention group where 
participants chose calming music from a provided list for a 30-min session. 
Inclusion criteria encompassed periods during pressure support ventilation, 
spontaneous breathing trials with tracheostomy or immediately after MV weaning. 
Hemodynamic, respiratory and electroencephalogram (EEG) parameters were 
collected before, during and after the intervention. Cortisol blood levels were 
also assessed. The primary outcome was the patient comfort and anxiety levels 
assessed using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS).
RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients out of 75 eligible patients were enrolled in the 
study (15 in the hypnosis group and 14 in the music intervention group). The 
comfort level increased from 4 [2-6] to 8 [7-9] (p < 0.01) and from 5 [4-6] to 7 
[5-8] (p < 0.01) for the hypnosis and music intervention groups, respectively 
(both p < 0.01). The anxiety level decreased from 5 [5-7] to 3 [2-5] (p < 0.01) 
and from 6 [5-8] to 4 [3-6] (p < 0.01) for the hypnosis and music intervention 
groups, respectively (both p < 0.01). No differences were observed between the 
study groups. Respiratory rate decreased after hypnosis from 28 [25-37] to 24 
[23-35] (p < 0.01), but was unchanged with music intervention. Heart rate showed 
a significant decline from baseline values after both interventions, but 
reverted to initial values subsequently. Mean arterial pressure exhibited an 
elevation from 94 (86-110) to 99 (80-108) mmHg after hypnosis (p = 0.01), while 
a reduction from 87 (75-101) to 82 (74-88) mmHg after music intervention 
(p = 0.01). Cortisol concentrations significantly decreased from 249 [175-291] 
to 207 [145-242] μg/L after music intervention (p = 0.02), but was unchanged 
after hypnosis (both p = 0.04). Both interventions led to a significant decrease 
in slow delta power and an increase in theta and alpha power on EEG, indicative 
of a hypnosis-like state.
CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, a single session of either hypnosis or music 
intervention was demonstrated to effectively reduce anxiety and enhance comfort, 
in critically ill patients facing extended or challenging MV weaning.
