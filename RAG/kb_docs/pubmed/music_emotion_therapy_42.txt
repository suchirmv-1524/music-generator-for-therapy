OBJECTIVE: The study aims to explore the effects of music therapy combined with 
hospice care on the quality of life and negative emotions of elderly patients 
with advanced breast cancer.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 240 elderly patients with 
advanced breast cancer who were treated at Yancheng Third People's Hospital and 
Yancheng First People's Hospital from January 2020 to June 2024. The patients 
were classified into the hospice care group and the music therapy group, with 
120 cases in each group. The hospice care group received only hospice care, 
while the music therapy group received music therapy combined with hospice care. 
Quality of life [Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B)], pain 
level [visual analog scale (VAS)], cancer-related fatigue symptoms [Brief 
Fatigue Inventory (BFI)], negative emotions [Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) and 
Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD)], and medication compliance were compared 
between the two groups.
RESULTS: After care, the FACT-B scores of the music therapy group were 
significantly higher than those of the hospice care group, whereas its VAS, BFI, 
HAMA, and HAMD scores were significantly lower in the music therapy group 
compared to the hospice care group (P < 0.05). The total compliance rate of the 
music therapy group was 96.67%, which was significantly higher than that of the 
hospice care group (80.00%, P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Music therapy combined with hospice care for elderly patients with 
breast cancer can effectively relieve their pain and cancer-related fatigue 
symptoms, reduce their negative emotions, and improve their therapy compliance 
and quality of life.
