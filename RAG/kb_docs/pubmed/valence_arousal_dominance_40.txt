INTRODUCTION: Emotions play a critical role in human communication, exerting a 
significant influence on brain function and behavior. One effective method of 
observing and analyzing these emotions is through electroencephalography (EEG) 
signals. Although numerous studies have been dedicated to emotion recognition 
(ER) using EEG signals, achieving improved accuracy in recognition remains a 
challenging task. To address this challenge, this paper presents a deep-learning 
approach for ER using EEG signals.
BACKGROUND: ER is a dynamic field of research with diverse practical 
applications in healthcare, human-computer interaction, and affective computing. 
In ER studies, EEG signals are frequently employed as they offer a non-invasive 
and cost-effective means of measuring brain activity. Nevertheless, accurately 
identifying emotions from EEG signals poses a significant challenge due to the 
intricate and non-linear nature of these signals.
METHODS: The present study proposes a novel approach for ER that encompasses 
multiple stages, including feature extraction, feature selection (FS) employing 
clustering, and classification using Dual-LSTM. To conduct the experiments, the 
DEAP dataset was employed, wherein a clustering technique was applied to Hurst's 
view and statistical features during the FS phase. Ultimately, Dual-LSTM was 
employed for accurate ER.
RESULTS: The proposed method achieved a remarkable accuracy of 97.5% in 
accurately classifying emotions across four categories: arousal, valence, 
liking/disliking, dominance, and familiarity. This high level of accuracy serves 
as strong evidence for the effectiveness of the deep-learning approach to 
emotion recognition (ER) utilizing EEG signals.
CONCLUSION: The deep-learning approach proposed in this paper has shown 
promising results in emotion recognition using EEG signals. This method can be 
useful in various applications, such as developing more effective therapies for 
individuals with mood disorders or improving human-computer interaction by 
allowing machines to respond more intelligently to users' emotional states. 
However, further research is needed to validate the proposed method on larger 
datasets and to investigate its applicability to real-world scenarios.
