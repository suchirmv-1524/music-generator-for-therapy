The main goals of a music appreciation course are to develop college students' 
emotions, improve their musical abilities, and strengthen their conceptual 
framework. This essay primarily introduces the fundamental elements and 
instructional approach of a music appreciation course built on core literacy. In 
order to clarify the need for and orientation of basic literacy in college music 
appreciation teaching, as well as to understand the special value of the 
subject, we conducted research on the relationship between basic literacy and 
college music appreciation teaching. Based on this, a new detection algorithm 
that fuses feature fusion and AM (attention mechanism) is proposed, and visual 
AM is added to the algorithm based on AM features to help the agent learn the 
best course of action quickly. The findings indicate that this method's 
cumulative normalized discount gain increases by about 0.07 and that the 
recommended list's overall quality has significantly improved. The hit ranking 
is decreased by about 0.05 when compared to the collaborative neural network 
filtering method without AM.
