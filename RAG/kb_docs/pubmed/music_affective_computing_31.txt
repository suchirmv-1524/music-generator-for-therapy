Affective computing research has advanced emotion recognition systems using 
facial expressions, voices, gaits, and physiological signals, yet these methods 
are often impractical. This study integrates mouse cursor motion analysis into 
affective computing and investigates the idea that movements of the computer 
cursor can provide information about emotion of the computer user. We extracted 
16-26 trajectory features during a choice-reaching task and examined the link 
between emotion and cursor motions. Participants were induced for positive or 
negative emotions by music, film clips, or emotional pictures, and they 
indicated their emotions with questionnaires. Our 10-fold cross-validation 
analysis shows that statistical models formed from "known" participants 
(training data) could predict nearly 10%-20% of the variance of positive affect 
and attentiveness ratings of "unknown" participants, suggesting that cursor 
movement patterns such as the area under curve and direction change help infer 
emotions of computer users.
