Background: Autistic children often face challenges with attention and emotion 
regulation, which can impact their socio-communication skills and overall 
well-being. Vibroacoustic therapy (VAT), a sensory-based intervention using 
low-frequency sound vibrations, may offer a novel approach to address these 
challenges. The objective of this pilot study is to explore the feasibility and 
potential efficacy of VAT in improving attention and emotion regulation in 
autistic children aged 9-12 years. Methods: Eighteen children were recruited 
with assistance from the school psychologist, using purposive sampling to 
identify participants with autism spectrum disorder and attentional challenges. 
The study was conducted at a primary school in Pretoria, South Africa, in March 
2023. Participants were divided into treatment (n = 9) and control (n = 9) 
groups. The treatment group underwent 10 VAT sessions over six weeks. Attention 
was assessed using the NEPSY-II and Joint-Attention Test (JTAT), focusing on 
sustained, selective, alternating, and joint attention. Qualitative data were 
collected through observations and creative semi-structured interviews to 
understand the children's experiences of VAT. Tests were conducted at baseline, 
midway, post-intervention, and one week post-intervention. Statistical analysis 
was conducted using a Generalised Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) in R version 4.3.1, 
with significance assessed using a Likelihood Ratio Test (p < 0.05) to assess 
attention improvements. Results: Quantitative analysis revealed significant 
improvements in joint attention in the treatment group (X2 = 11.64, df = 3, p = 
0.008). Qualitative findings highlighted positive experiences related to emotion 
regulation, with children reporting a sense of calm and enjoyment during VAT 
sessions. Teachers also noted improvements in attention and engagement. 
Conclusions: VAT appears to be a feasible and acceptable intervention for 
autistic children, with potential benefits for attention and emotion regulation. 
These findings support further research to validate its efficacy and explore its 
adaptability for diverse sensory profiles. VAT may hold promise as a holistic 
therapeutic tool in autism intervention programmes.
