Recent research has demonstrated that resting-state functional connectivity 
(RS-FC) within the human auditory cortex (HAC) is frequency-selective, but 
whether RS-FC between the HAC and other brain areas is differentiated by 
frequency remains unclear. Three types of data were collected in this study, 
including resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, 
task-based fMRI data using six pure tone stimuli (200, 400, 800, 1,600, 3,200, 
and 6,400 Hz), and structural imaging data. We first used task-based fMRI to 
identify frequency-selective cortical regions in the HAC. Six regions of 
interest (ROIs) were defined based on the responses of 50 participants to the 
six pure tone stimuli. Then, these ROIs were used as seeds to determine RS-FC 
between the HAC and other brain regions. The results showed that there was RS-FC 
between the HAC and brain regions that included the superior temporal gyrus, 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DL-PFC), parietal cortex, occipital lobe, and 
subcortical structures. Importantly, significant differences in FC were observed 
among most of the brain regions that showed RS-FC with the HAC. Specifically, 
there was stronger RS-FC between (1) low-frequency (200 and 400 Hz) regions and 
brain regions including the premotor cortex, somatosensory/-association cortex, 
and DL-PFC; (2) intermediate-frequency (800 and 1,600 Hz) regions and brain 
regions including the anterior/posterior superior temporal sulcus, supramarginal 
gyrus, and inferior frontal cortex; (3) intermediate/low-frequency regions and 
vision-related regions; (4) high-frequency (3,200 and 6,400 Hz) regions and the 
anterior cingulate cortex or left DL-PFC. These findings demonstrate that RS-FC 
between the HAC and other brain areas is frequency selective.
