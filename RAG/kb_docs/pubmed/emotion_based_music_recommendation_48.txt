Background: Amplified cardiopulmonary recording (ACPR) is a unique music therapy 
intervention implementing recorded heartbeats with meaningful music. Although 
its clinical application has grown, there is limited research on the 
acceptability and usage by bereaved families. Objective: The research objective 
was to understand the frequency recipients engaged with ACPR after their loved 
one died. Design: A survey was undertaken with relatives of 191 adult patients 
who had participated in ACPR. Setting/Subjects: Bereaved loved ones of adult 
oncology patients who received care at the Norton Cancer Institute in 
Louisville, Kentucky, USA. Results: Out of the 191 participants, 73% of family 
members responded, 49% reported listening to their recording frequently, 31% 
listened to the recording at least once after receiving it, and 20% reported 
never listening. Conclusions: ACPR appears to have moderate acceptability and 
usage among bereaved family members, especially when created in the context of 
ongoing music therapy treatment. We recommend that this process-based music 
therapy intervention be studied further and offered proactively.
