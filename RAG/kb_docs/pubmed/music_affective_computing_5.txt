DAST: A Domain-Adaptive Learning Combining Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Attention for 
Electroencephalography Emotion Recognition.

Jin H, Gao Y, Wang T, Gao P.

Multimodal emotion recognition with EEG-based have become mainstream in 
affective computing. However, previous studies mainly focus on perceived 
emotions (including posture, speech or face expression et al.) of different 
subjects, while the lack of research on induced emotions (including video or 
music et al.) limited the development of two-ways emotions. To solve this 
problem, we propose a multimodal domain adaptive method based on EEG and music 
called the DAST, which uses spatio-temporal adaptive attention (STA-attention) 
to globally model the EEG and maps all embeddings dynamically into 
high-dimensionally space by adaptive space encoder (ASE). Then, adversarial 
training is performed with domain discriminator and ASE to learn invariant 
emotion representations. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on the 
DEAP dataset, and the results show that our method can further explore the 
relationship between induced and perceived emotions, and provide a reliable 
reference for exploring the potential correlation between EEG and music 
stimulation.
