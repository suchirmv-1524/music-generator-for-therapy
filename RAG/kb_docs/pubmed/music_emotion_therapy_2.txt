This study investigated the efficacy of combining binaural beat music (BBM) with 
rhythmical photic stimulation at the α frequency in alleviating anxiety among 
daycare staff and explored its impacts on daycare staff with different anxiety 
levels. A quasi-experimental research design was adopted, which included three 
interventions: BBM, BBM integrated with rhythmical photic stimulation, and 
relaxation music (control group). Participants completed a questionnaire prior 
to the first intervention, which included personal demographic information and 
the Beck Anxiety Inventory. The effects of these interventions on anxiety relief 
among daycare staff were evaluated through heart rate variability (HRV), brain 
waves, and blood pressure before and after the interventions. Statistical 
analysis primarily employed the Friedman test to analyze the differences in 
changes in HRV, brain waves, and blood pressure before and after the 
interventions. A total of 40 individuals participated in this study (16 males 
and 24 females), with an average age of 31.73 ± 8.83 years. The results showed 
that, compared to BBM alone, BBM integrated with rhythmical photic stimulation 
significantly reduced the normalized low/high frequency (nLF/nHF) ratio in 
participants with moderate anxiety (p < 0.05). The results suggest that BBM 
integrated with rhythmical photic stimulation may serve as an intervention for 
the prevention and relief of anxiety by regulating an individual's autonomic 
nervous system. However, further research is required to confirm these findings.
