Wearable technology is playing an increasing role in the development of 
user-centric applications. In the field of sports, this technology is being used 
to implement solutions that improve athletes' performance, reduce the risk of 
injury, or control fatigue, for example. Emotions are involved in most of these 
solutions, but unfortunately, they are not monitored in real-time or used as a 
decision element that helps to increase the quality of training sessions, nor 
are they used to guarantee the health of athletes. In this paper, we present a 
wearable and a set of machine learning models that are able to deduce runners' 
emotions during their training. The solution is based on the analysis of 
runners' electrodermal activity, a physiological parameter widely used in the 
field of emotion recognition. As part of the DJ-Running project, we have used 
these emotions to increase runners' motivation through music. It has required 
integrating the wearable and the models into the DJ-Running mobile application, 
which interacts with the technological infrastructure of the project to select 
and play the most suitable songs at each instant of the training.
