Neurological disorders represent a significant challenge for healthcare systems, 
necessitating innovative and multidisciplinary therapeutic approaches. These 
disorders often lead to difficulties in various aspects of daily life, including 
physical functioning, mental health, and quality of life (QoL). Telecoaching 
(TC) and Music Therapy (MT) are two emerging modalities that may provide 
valuable support for individuals with these conditions. This narrative review 
aims to analyse recent studies investigating the efficacy of TC and MT in this 
population. A total of 23 studies were included in this narrative review. These 
studies indicate that TC positively affects physical functioning and adherence 
to intervention programs, with participants reporting improvements in gait and 
balance, as well as a reduction in postural instability and fall rates. 
Similarly, MT has shown promising outcomes in decreasing anxiety and sleep 
disorders while enhancing cognitive and emotional well-being. Integrating TC and 
MT into treatment approaches offers a promising alternative for improving QoL 
and overall well-being. However, further research is needed to consolidate the 
evidence and optimize the implementation of these interventions in clinical 
practice. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies and comparative 
evaluations to further clarify the role of TC and MT in the treatment of 
neurological disorders, as well as their long-term effects.
