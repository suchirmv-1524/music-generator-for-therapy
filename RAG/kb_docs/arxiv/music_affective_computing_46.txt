Title: Computational Complexity of Arranging Music

Abstract: This paper proves that arrangement of music is NP-hard when subject to various constraints: avoiding musical dissonance, limiting how many notes can be played simultaneously, and limiting transition speed between chords. These results imply the computational complexity of related musical problems, including musical choreography and rhythm games.
