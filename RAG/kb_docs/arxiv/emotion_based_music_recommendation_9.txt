Title: Emotion-Aware Music Recommendation System: Enhancing User Experience   Through Real-Time Emotional Context

Abstract: This study addresses the deficiency in conventional music recommendation systems by focusing on the vital role of emotions in shaping users music choices. These systems often disregard the emotional context, relying predominantly on past listening behavior and failing to consider the dynamic and evolving nature of users emotional preferences. This gap leads to several limitations. Users may receive recommendations that do not match their current mood, which diminishes the quality of their music experience. Furthermore, without accounting for emotions, the systems might overlook undiscovered or lesser-known songs that have a profound emotional impact on users. To combat these limitations, this research introduces an AI model that incorporates emotional context into the song recommendation process. By accurately detecting users real-time emotions, the model can generate personalized song recommendations that align with the users emotional state. This approach aims to enhance the user experience by offering music that resonates with their current mood, elicits the desired emotions, and creates a more immersive and meaningful listening experience. By considering emotional context in the song recommendation process, the proposed model offers an opportunity for a more personalized and emotionally resonant musical journey.
