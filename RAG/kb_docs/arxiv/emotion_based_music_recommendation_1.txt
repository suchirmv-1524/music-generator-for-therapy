Title: BEAMERS: Brain-Engaged, Active Music-based Emotion Regulation System

Abstract: With the increasing demands of emotion comprehension and regulation in our daily life, a customized music-based emotion regulation system is introduced by employing current EEG information and song features, which predicts users' emotion variation in the valence-arousal model before recommending music. The work shows that: (1) a novel music-based emotion regulation system with a commercial EEG device is designed without employing deterministic emotion recognition models for daily usage; (2) the system considers users' variant emotions towards the same song, and by which calculate user's emotion instability and it is in accordance with Big Five Personality Test; (3) the system supports different emotion regulation styles with users' designation of desired emotion variation, and achieves an accuracy of over $0.85$ with 2-seconds EEG data; (4) people feel easier to report their emotion variation comparing with absolute emotional states, and would accept a more delicate music recommendation system for emotion regulation according to the questionnaire.
