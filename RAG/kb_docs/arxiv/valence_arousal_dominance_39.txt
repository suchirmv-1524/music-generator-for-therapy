Title: Mamba-VA: A Mamba-based Approach for Continuous Emotion Recognition in   Valence-Arousal Space

Abstract: Continuous Emotion Recognition (CER) plays a crucial role in intelligent human-computer interaction, mental health monitoring, and autonomous driving. Emotion modeling based on the Valence-Arousal (VA) space enables a more nuanced representation of emotional states. However, existing methods still face challenges in handling long-term dependencies and capturing complex temporal dynamics. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel emotion recognition model, Mamba-VA, which leverages the Mamba architecture to efficiently model sequential emotional variations in video frames. First, the model employs a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) to extract deep visual features from video frames, enhancing the robustness of temporal information. Then, a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) is utilized for temporal modeling to capture local temporal dependencies. Subsequently, Mamba is applied for long-sequence modeling, enabling the learning of global emotional trends. Finally, a fully connected (FC) layer performs regression analysis to predict continuous valence and arousal values. Experimental results on the Valence-Arousal (VA) Estimation task of the 8th competition on Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) demonstrate that the proposed model achieves valence and arousal scores of 0.5362 (0.5036) and 0.4310 (0.4119) on the validation (test) set, respectively, outperforming the baseline.
