Title: EmoGen: Eliminating Subjective Bias in Emotional Music Generation

Abstract: Music is used to convey emotions, and thus generating emotional music is important in automatic music generation. Previous work on emotional music generation directly uses annotated emotion labels as control signals, which suffers from subjective bias: different people may annotate different emotions on the same music, and one person may feel different emotions under different situations. Therefore, directly mapping emotion labels to music sequences in an end-to-end way would confuse the learning process and hinder the model from generating music with general emotions. In this paper, we propose EmoGen, an emotional music generation system that leverages a set of emotion-related music attributes as the bridge between emotion and music, and divides the generation into two stages: emotion-to-attribute mapping with supervised clustering, and attribute-to-music generation with self-supervised learning. Both stages are beneficial: in the first stage, the attribute values around the clustering center represent the general emotions of these samples, which help eliminate the impacts of the subjective bias of emotion labels; in the second stage, the generation is completely disentangled from emotion labels and thus free from the subjective bias. Both subjective and objective evaluations show that EmoGen outperforms previous methods on emotion control accuracy and music quality respectively, which demonstrate our superiority in generating emotional music. Music samples generated by EmoGen are available via this link:https://ai-muzic.github.io/emogen/, and the code is available at this link:https://github.com/microsoft/muzic/.
