Title: A Novel Multi-Task Learning Method for Symbolic Music Emotion   Recognition

Abstract: Symbolic Music Emotion Recognition(SMER) is to predict music emotion from symbolic data, such as MIDI and MusicXML. Previous work mainly focused on learning better representation via (mask) language model pre-training but ignored the intrinsic structure of the music, which is extremely important to the emotional expression of music. In this paper, we present a simple multi-task framework for SMER, which incorporates the emotion recognition task with other emotion-related auxiliary tasks derived from the intrinsic structure of the music. The results show that our multi-task framework can be adapted to different models. Moreover, the labels of auxiliary tasks are easy to be obtained, which means our multi-task methods do not require manually annotated labels other than emotion. Conducting on two publicly available datasets (EMOPIA and VGMIDI), the experiments show that our methods perform better in SMER task. Specifically, accuracy has been increased by 4.17 absolute point to 67.58 in EMOPIA dataset, and 1.97 absolute point to 55.85 in VGMIDI dataset. Ablation studies also show the effectiveness of multi-task methods designed in this paper.
